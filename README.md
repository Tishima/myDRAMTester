This repository contains all eagle files, gerber file, BOM, schematics

Depending on where the parts and pcbs are purchased, the price for the complete shield is around 6â‚¬ (2023), without Arduino UNO and power supply
I built this project, because the PCB on PCBWay has to small holes for all ZIF Sockets
